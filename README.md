# Rust EVM Integration Template

Welcome to the Rust EVM Integration Template! This project serves as a comprehensive example of connecting to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) using Rust, leveraging the `ether-rs` library. Whether you're a seasoned Rust developer or just getting started with blockchain development, this template provides a solid foundation for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum or Ethereum-compatible networks.

## Features

- **Full Stack Rust**: The project is built entirely in Rust, enabling high-performance and secure blockchain interactions.
- **EVM Integration**: Utilizes the `ether-rs` library for seamless communication with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing for smart contract deployment, transaction execution, and more.
- **Template Structure**: Organized into clear directories for frontend and backend components, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **WebAssembly Support**: Integration with WebAssembly for efficient execution of Rust code in web environments.
- **Example Contracts**: Includes example Solidity smart contracts for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

...coming soon

## Directory Structure
- **`frontend/`**: Houses the frontend code for interacting with the backend and displaying data to users.
  
...the rest coming soon

- **`backend/`**: Contains the Rust backend code for interacting with the Ethereum network using `ether-rs`.
- **`contracts/`**: Includes example Solidity smart contracts for testing and demonstration purposes.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation folder, including guides, API references, and project-specific documentation.
